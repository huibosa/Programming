What does the condition in the following if statement do?

```cpp
if(read(read(cin, data1), data2))
```

we can try to divide it like that:

```
std::istream &firstStep = read(cin, data1);
sdt::istream &secondStep = read(firstStep, data2);
if (secondStep)
```

the condition of the `if` statement would read two Sales_data object at one
time.
