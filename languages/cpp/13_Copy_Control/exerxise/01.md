> What is a copy constructor? When is it used?

A copy constructor is a constructor which first parameter is a **reference** to
the class type and any additional parameters have **default values**.

When copy initialization happens and that copy initialization requires either
the copy constructor or the move constructor.

* Define variables using an `=`
* Pass an object as an argument to a parameter of nonreference type
* Return an object from a function that has a nonreference return type
* Brace initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class
* Some class types also use copy initialization for the objects they allocate.
