* Copy constructor and copy-assignment operator should dynamically allocate
  memory for its own , rather than share the object with the right hand
  operand.
* `StrBlob` is using smart pointers which can be managed with synthesized
  destructor, If an object of `StrBlob` is out of scope, the destructor for
  std::shared_ptr will be called automatically to free the memory dynamically
  allocated when the `use_count` goes to 0.
