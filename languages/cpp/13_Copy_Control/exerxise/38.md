@Mooophy The copy and swap is an elegant way when working with dynamicly
allocated memory. In the Message class, nothing is allocated dynamically. Thus
using this idiom makes no sense and will make it more complicated to implement
due to the pointers that point back.

@pezy In this case, `swap` function is special. It will be clear two
`Message`'s folders , then swap members, and added themselves to each folders.
But, `Message` assignment operator just clear itself, and copy the members, and
added itself to each folders. The `rhs` don't need to clear and add to folders.
So, if using copy and swap to define, it will be very inefficiency.
