recursion and stack overflow.

@miaojiuchen:
Because the local variable `ret` here is an Lvalue, so when we call
`ret.sorted()`, we are actually not calling the member function `Foo
Foo::sorted() &&` as expected, but `Foo Foo::sorted() const &` instead. As a
result, the code will be trapped into a recursion and causes a deadly stack
overflow.
