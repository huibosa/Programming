Exercise 14.3: Both string and vector define an overloaded == that can
be used to compare objects of those types. Assuming svec1 and svec2 are
vectors that hold strings, identify which version of == is applied in each
of the following expressions:

1. "cobble" == "stone"
2. svec1[0] == svec2[0]
3. svec1 == svec2
4. "svec1[0] == "stone" 

Answer:

1. `nether`
2. `string`
3. `vector`
4. `string`
