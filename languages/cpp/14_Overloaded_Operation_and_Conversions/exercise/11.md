Exercise 14.11: What, if anything, is wrong with the following Sales_data
input operator? What would happen if we gave this operator the data in the
previous exercise?
 
```cpp
istream& operator>>(istream& in, Sales_data& s)
{
    double price;
    in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
    s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
    return in;
}
```

no input check, nothing happened
