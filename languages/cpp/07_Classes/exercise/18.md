> What is encapsulation? Why is it useful

encapsulation is the separation of implementation from interface. It hides the
implementation details of a type. (In C++, encapsulation is enforced by putting
the implementation in the private part of a class)

Important advantages:

* User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulation object.
* The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without
  requiring changes in user-level code.
