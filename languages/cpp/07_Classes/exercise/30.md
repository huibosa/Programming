> Exercise 7.30: It is legal but redundant to refer to members through the this
> pointer. Discuss the pros and cons of explicitly using the this pointer

**Pros**

- more explicit
- less scope for misreading
- can use the member function parameter which name is same as the member name.

        void setAddr(const std::string &addr) { this->addr = addr; }

**Cons**

- more to read
- sometimes redundant

        std::string getAddr() const { return this->addr; } // unnecessary
