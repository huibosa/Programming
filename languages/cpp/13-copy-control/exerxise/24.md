* If `HasPtr` didn't define a destructor, a memory leak would occur, compiler
  synthesized destructor does not manage dynamic memory.
* If `HasPtr` didn't define the copy constructor, we would get pointer-like
  copy behaviour. The ps pointer would be copied to the left hand side, but ps
  in the lhs and the rhs would still point to the same string on the heap.
