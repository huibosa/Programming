**Rewrite**

```cpp
for_each(elements, first_free, [this](std::string &rhs){ alloc.destroy(&rhs); });
```

@Mooophy: The new version is better. Compared to the old one, it doesn't need
to worry about the order and decrement.So more straightforward and handy. The
only thing to do for using this approach is to add "&" to build the pointers to
string pointers.
