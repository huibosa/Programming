> What is a function template? What is a class template?

A function template is a formula from which we can generate type-specific
versions of that function.

A class template is a blueprint for generating classes. Class templates
differ from function templates in that the compiler cannot deduce the
template parameter type(s) for a class template. Instead, as we’ve seen
many times, to use a class template we must supply additional information
inside angle brackets following the template’s name (§ 3.3, p. 97).
