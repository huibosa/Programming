If you would like to implement the compound operator in terms of the binary
operator, the sequence of actions would be as follows:

Compound assignment calls the binary operator

* The binary operator creates a new object from one of the objects (copy #1),
  and puts the sum into it
* The sum is returned by value (copy #2)
* The sum object is copied into the object on the left-hand side object (copy
  #3)

If you do it the other way around, the last copy is eliminated:

* Binary operator creates an object representing the sum from the left-hand
  side object
* Binary operator invokes the compound addition-assignment, which does not
  require copying
* Binary operator returns the object by value (copy #2)
