members:

* (a) %
* (b) %=
* (c) ++
* (d) ->
* (e) <<
* (f) &&
* (g) ==
* (h) ().

* (a) symmetic, non-member
* (b) changing state of objects, member
* (c) changing state of objects, member
* (d) = () [] -> must be member
* (e) non-member
* (f) symetric, non-member
* (g) symetric, non-member
* (h) = () [] -> must be member
