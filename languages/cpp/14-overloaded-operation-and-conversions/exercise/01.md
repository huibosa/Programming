Exercise 14.1: In what ways does an overloaded operator differ from a
built-in operator? In what ways are overloaded operators the same as the
built-in operators?

Differ:

1. We can call an overloaded operator function directly.
2. An overloaded operator function must either be a member of a class or have
   at least one parameter of class type.
3. A few operators guarantee the order in which operands are evaluated. These
   overloaded versions of these operators do not preserve order of evaluation
   and/or short-circuit evaluation, it is usually a bad idea to overload them.

> In particular, the operand-evaluation guarantees of the logical AND, logical
> OR, and comma operators are not preserved, Moreover, overloaded versions of
> && or || operators do not preserve short-circuit evaluation properties of the
> built-in operators. Both operands are always evaluated.

Same:

* An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as the
  corresponding built-in operator.
