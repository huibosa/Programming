1.1.25 Use mathematical induction to prove that Euclid’s algorithm computes the
greatest common divisor of any pair of nonnegative integers p and q.

------------------------------

For all N E NaturalNumbers and for all nonnegative integers a <= N and b <= N, the Euclidean algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Proving that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)

gcd(20,5) = gcd(5,0)

gcd(20,5) is 5
gcd(5,0) is also 5
