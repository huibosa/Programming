1.5.9 Draw the tree corresponding to the id[] array depicted at 
right. Can this be the result of running weighted quick-union? 
Explain why this is impossible or give a sequence of operations 
that results in this array.


```
  i    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
id[i]  1 1 3 1 5 6 1 3 4 5
```
  
```
            1
          / | \
         0  3  6
           /|   \
          2 7    5
                / \
               4   9
              /
             8
```

This forest cannot be the result of running weighted quick-union.

Consider the tree composed of nodes 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, its height is 4, which is higher than lg N

lg 6 = 3 < 4

Therefore it does not hold the proposition that **the depth of any node in a forest built by weighted quick-union for N sites is at most lg N**.
