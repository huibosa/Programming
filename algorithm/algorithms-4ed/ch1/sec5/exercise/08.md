1.5.8 Give a counterexample that shows why this intuitive implementation of union()
for quick-find is not correct:

```java
public void union(int p, int q) {
  if (connected(p, q)) return;

  // Rename p's component to q's name
  for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++) {
    if (id[i] == id[p]) {
      id[i] = id[q];
    }
  }
  
  count--;
}

```

In the loop, id[p] will eventually be set to id[q], losing the reference to the original parent.
This will make the next elements with id[i] == id[p] to not have their values updated.

Counterexample:

```
id[p] = 2
id[q] = 4
```

Array:

0 1 2 2 4 2 6

* 0 != 2, is not updated
* 1 != 2, is not updated
* 2 == 2, is updated to 4 (after this, all comparisons are incorrectly made with 4 instead of 2)
* 2 != 4 is not updated (and should have been updated)
* 4 == 4 is updated to 4 (again)
* 2 != 4 is not updated (and should have been updated)
* 6 != 4 is not updated
