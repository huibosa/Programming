1.2.8 Suppose that a[] and b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of inte-
gers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient?

```cpp
int[] t = a; a = b; b = t;
```

Answer. It swaps them. It could hardly be more efficient because it does so by copying 
references, so that it is not necessary to copy millions of elements.
